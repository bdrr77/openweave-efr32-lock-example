## Introduction

![EFR32 MG12 + WSTK](doc/images/efr32-mg12-wstk.jpg)

The EFR32 lock example application provides a working demonstration of a connected door lock device, built using OpenWeave, OpenThread and the Silicon Labs
gecko SDK. The example supports remote access and control of a simulated door lock over a low-power, 802.15.4 Thread network.  It is capable of being paired into
an existing Weave network along with other Weave-enabled devices, and supports communication (via a Weave border router device) with the Nest service.  The
example targets the Silicon Labs EFR32 SDK, but is readily adaptable to other EFR32-based hardware. 

The lock example is intended to serve both as a means to explore the workings of OpenWeave and OpenThread, as well as a template for creating real
products based on the Silicon Labs platform. 

The example application builds upon the [OpenWeave](https://github.com/openweave/openweave-core/) and [OpenThread](https://github.com/openthread/openthread)
projects, which are incorporated as submodules and built from source.  A top-level Makefile orchestrates the entire build process, including building OpenWeave,
OpenThread and select files from the Silicon Labs SDK.  The resultant image file can be flashed directly onto the Silicon Labs WSTK kit hardware.

## Software Architecture

 The lock example is built on the Weave application layer framework provided by [openweave-core](https://github.com/openweave/openweave-core/) . 
 At the heart of this are the **Weave Core** components.  These components provide the essential functionality required to speak Weave.
 This includes code for encoding and decoding Weave messages, communicating Weave messages over various transports (TCP, UDP, BLE), tracking
 Weave conversations (exchanges) and negotiating secure communications.

The **Weave Profiles** sit atop the core components and provide support for specific types of Weave interactions.  Central among these is the Weave Data
Management profile (**WDM**), which provides a generalized protocol for communicating state, configuration settings, commands and events between Weave
nodes.  Other profiles support device provisioning (pairing), OTA software update, time synchronization, and device identification and control.

The **Weave Device Layer** serves to adapt the portable Weave Core and Profile components to run in the context of a particular device platform.  In the case
of the lock example, the device platform is the EFR32 MG12 or MG21.  Additionally, the Device Layer also provides platform-neutral
services (APIs) to the application for performing certain fundamental operations that are common to all Weave devices.  These include managing a deviceâ€™s
persistent configuration, managing its network connectivity, scheduling and orchestrating OTA software updates and others.

The lock example makes use of various components provided by the **Silicon Labs SDK**, including BLE support libraries, persistent storage management,
crypto services, logging and others.  **FreeRTOS** is used to support multi-threading and task synchronization.   **SEGGER RTT** support
provides access to log output using the J-Jink debug probe built in to the EFR32 Wireless Starter Kit (**WSTK**) Kit.  

**OpenThread** provides the core Thread stack implementation and manages persistent storage of Thread network configuration.  The **LwIP** Lightweight IP
stack provides IP services on top of Thread, including TCP, UDP and ICMPv6.

The **Silicon Labs EFR32 SDK** provides a BLE protocol stack and Dynamic Multiprotocol (**DMP**) support for simultaneous use of BLE and Thread.

## Example Application Design

The lock example application uses the Weave Data Management protocol (WDM) to enable remote access to state and control of a simulated door lock.  The
application implements the standard Nest-defined schema for a consumer-grade bolt lock.  In particular, the application publishes the `security.BoltLockTrait`, which
it uses to expose the overall state of the lock, and its bolt, to outside consumers.  In turn, the application consumes the properties of the `security.BoltLockSettingsTrait`
as published by the Nest service.  These properties contain user-supplied settings that configure the desired behavior of the device.

As part of implementing the BoltLockTrait, the application also responds to `BoltLockChangeRequest` commands instructing it to change the state of the bolt.  This
provides the ability to remotely lock and unlock the door.  To better simulate real lock hardware, the application incorporates a short delay mimicking the actuation
time of the bolt.

Whenever the state of the bolt changes, the application emits a `BoltActuatorStateChangeEvent`.  This event describes the end result of the change (bolt extended or
retracted), when the change happened and the actor or action that initiated it.  This is conveyed to the Nest service in a reliable manner.

Together, the features of the lock example have been designed to illustrate the four core interaction patterns typical of devices that use Weave and the
Weave Data Management protocol; namely:

- Publishing local state
- Subscribing to remote settings
- Reacting to received commands
- Emitting events


<a name="device-ui"></a>

## Device UI

The example application provides a simple UI that depicts the state of the device and offers basic user control.  This UI is implemented via the general-purpose
LEDs and buttons built in to the EFR32 WSTK development board.

**LED #0** shows the overall state of the device and its connectivity.  Four states are depicted:

- *Short Flash On (50ms on/950ms off)* &mdash; The device is in an unprovisioned (unpaired) state and is waiting for a commissioning application to connect.


- *Rapid Even Flashing (100ms on/100ms off)* &mdash; The device is in an unprovisioned state and a commissioning application is connected via BLE.


- *Short Flash Off (950ms on/50ms off)* &mdash; The device is full provisioned, but does not yet have full network (Thread) or service connectivity.


- *Solid On* &mdash; The device is fully provisioned and has full network and service connectivity.


**Button PB0** can be used to initiate a OTA software update as well as to reset the device to a default state. 

A brief press of Button PB0 instructs the device to perform a software update query to the Nest service.  Should the service indicate a software update is  available, the device
will download the corresponding software image file.  This feature is only available once the device completed the pairing process. While software update is running, another brief press on Button PB0 will abort it.

Pressing and holding Button PB0 for 6 seconds initiates a factory reset.  After an initial period of 3 seconds, all four LED will flash in unison to signal the pending reset.  Holding the button past 6 seconds will cause the device to reset its persistent configuration and initiate a reboot.  The reset action can be cancelled by releasing the button at any point before the 6 second limit.

**LED #1** shows the state of the simulated lock bolt.  When the LED is lit the bolt is extended (i.e. door locked); when not lit, the bolt is retracted (door unlocked).  The LED will flash whenever the simulated bolt is in motion from one position to another.

**Button PB1** can be used to change the state of the simulated bolt.  This can be used to mimick a user manually operating the lock.  The button behaves as a toggle, swapping the state every time it is pressed.

<a name="view-logging"></a>

## Viewing Logging Output

The example application is built to use the SEGGER Real Time Transfer (RTT) facility for log output.  RTT is a feature built-in to the J-Link Interface MCU on the WSTK development board. It allows bi-directional communication with an embedded application without the need for a dedicated UART.

Using the RTT facility requires downloading and installing the *SEGGER J-Link Software and Documentation Pack* ([web site](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack)).  Alternatively the *SEGGER Ozone - J-Link Debugger* can be used to view RTT logs.

* Download the J-Link installer by navigating to the appropriate URL and agreeing to the license agreement. 

 * [JLink_Linux_x86_64.deb](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/JLink_Linux_x86_64.deb)
 * [JLink_MacOSX.pkg](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/JLink_MacOSX.pkg)


* Install the J-Link software

        $ cd ~/Downloads
        $ sudo dpkg -i JLink_Linux_V*_x86_64.deb

* In Linux, grant the logged in user the ability to talk to the development hardware via the linux tty device (/dev/ttyACMx) by adding them to the dialout group.

        $ sudo usermod -a -G dialout ${USER} 

Once the above is complete, log output can be viewed using the JLinkExe tool in combination with JLinkRTTClient as follows:

* Run the JLinkExe tool with arguments to autoconnect to the WSTK board:

    For MG12 use:
        
        $ JLinkExe -device EFR32MG12PXXXF1024 -if JTAG -speed 4000 -autoconnect 1

    For MG21 use:

        $ JLinkExe -device EFR32MG21AXXXF1024 -if SWD -speed 4000 -autoconnect 1

* In a second terminal, run the JLinkRTTClient to view logs:

        $ JLinkRTTClient
